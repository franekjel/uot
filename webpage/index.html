                            <h1>Universe Of Technology</h1>
                            <p class="lead">
                                The game was designed and implemented as an university project of six students at the Warsaw University of Technology, 
                                at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science in the field of Computer Science and Information Systems with a specialization in CAD/CAM systems design.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The goal of the project was to deliver a 4X online video game, which allow a simultaneous gameplay for many players on one server.
                                Work began with designing the game. Then a technical specification was created and scenarios were outlined. Later, the focus was on choosing the technologies in which the game was written.
                                Finally, the C++ programming language with SDL graphics library was chosen. It allows to use graphics easily and handle audio features. 
                                In the field of communication between modules, the Game Networking Sockets library was used.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the game users can create their own servers and join them to play together. The main goal of the game is to eliminate other players' fleets and take over their territories.
                                It can be done in many ways, but the most important to build them, is to have large amounts of resources that are obtained from colonized planets and asteroids, as well as from stars.
                                During the game, the player discovers new star systems that he can colonize or take over. He gets resources all the time and can build new fleets. Acceleration of development is possible by taking over other parts of the galaxy, but also via discovering new technologies and developing his skills.
                                The development tree is very extensive and requires attention when choosing the right technologies for your own gameplay strategy. Good choices accelerate development and allow domination.

                            <p> Only the strongest will survive...
                                Join them and become a part of the intergalactic empire!!!
